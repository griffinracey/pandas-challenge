Challenge Assignment 4 - Pandas

I used what I could from the starter code and followed the steps in that code. I also used the solutions to various in-class activites to assist with this challenge. 

I used this website W3Schools for a majority of the help with the syntax and parameters of pandas functions (mean, sum, merge, etc.).
https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp

The page about dataframes helped for different ways to access Dataframes 
https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_dataframes.asp

For the highest and lowest performing schools I used this website to help me with the sort_values function.
